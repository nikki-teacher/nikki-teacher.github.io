          Nikki is brilliant at engaging our daughter and encouraging her in maths and literacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though our daughter is not always keen to have extra lessons have school she comes away smiling.
          Nikki has been great at creating this confidence and understanding, which is translating into school work too.  
          When we or our daughter have had had worries about particular things from school or wanted extra revision, Nikki has quickly adapted lessons to support. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, we are delighted with the supportive encouragement and the consequent progress, happy to recommend to other people, and have done so.

    <p>
      Nikki has been working with my son for two years. Following homeschooling my son was excelling in class. He was above average. However, returning back to school he suddenly became average. I spoke extensively with the school and they made it clear this was where he was academically. I disagreed, therefore contacted Nikki. She listened to my concerns. Nikki assessed my son. Came up with a plan going forward.
      After each session she discusses progress and her suggestions on areas to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference in my son is incredible. He is back up to being above average. The school is very impressed.
      But not only has he improved academically his attitude and confidence has dramatically increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loves his sessions. They have fun but clearly work extremely hard. Nikki sets homework if required. She works with each individual child and makes sure the work is of interest to them. My son is able to select the topics they study which makes a big difference. She is easy to contact. Very accessible and works around you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would absolutely recommend Nikki for your child without hesitation. We will be continuing with Nikki for as long as she is available. She is such a worthwhile investment into your child's future.
